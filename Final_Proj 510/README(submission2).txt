\f0\fs24 \cf0 This python script has the capability to extract data from 1/3 data sources. The three sources utilized in the project concern per capita statistics by world nations regarding automobile counts, emissions (by kilos), and GDP. The scraper.py script autonomously scrapes vehicle per capita data from the wikipedia source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_vehicles_per_capita. With appropriate terminal commands entered when executing the scraper.py script within the respective directory such as \'97parse (optional integer value) and \'97save (filepath/filename), the script has the ability to display \'92n\'92 values of the automobile dataset along with saving the file.\
\
The remaining two data sources are imported in scraper.py file applicable for use via additional python code leveraging the argparse library. The datasets are merged and utilized in conjunction in order to study per capita values of GDP and automobile counts on emissions in tons per capita. Aggregate statistics with associated visualizations, correlation analysis, independent sample t-tests, and linear regression modeling will be completed on the merged datasets to study the relationship between per capita features.\
