    "\n",
    "- You have to complete the assignments individually. If you are having trouble completing the assignment do let the TAs know/post on Piazza.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please don't copy code (either partially/fully) from your classmates. Plagiarism of any form will result in a 0 and you will be reported to SJACS (https://sjacs.usc.edu/students/academic-integrity/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- You have to fill the code in this notebook and upload it for submission. While doing this, make sure all supporting files that you download from D2L are in the same directory as this notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- File Naming Convention : Lab7_LastName_FirstName.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't change existing methods (if any, unless otherwise mentioned in the instructions)\n",
    "\n",
    "- You are encouraged to look up resources online like python docs and stackoverflow. Look up the topics and not the questions themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Your last submission before the deadline will be counted towards your grade. You can submit any number of times before the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You need to take input from file/console only if it is mentioned in the question. If not we need just the logic/implementation of your function.\n",

    "- Scores are capped at 10 points including the Bonus problem. For Example: Even if you get a score of 12/10, your score is capped at 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bonus score is counted only if the first 2 questions are attempted. Don't attempt the bonus question if you haven't attempted the first 2.\n",
